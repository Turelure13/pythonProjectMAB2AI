Model ARMA process for stock price and compare it with RNN results 

## Process for ARMA/ARIMA models

* Analyzing Time Series Data
* Test for Random Walk
* Take first differences
* Compute ACF and PACF
* Fit a few AR, MA, and ARMA models
* Use Information Criterion to choose best model ( AIC, BIC )
* Forecast Time series over the past data
